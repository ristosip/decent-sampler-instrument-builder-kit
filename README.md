Before sending in a bug report, please take the following steps:
1. Double-check for a user error. Please see the documention in the script files and the tutorial videos for help.
2. Make sure the unexpected behavior is replicable using the newest unmodified script file. 
	* This rule can be relaxed when it comes to modifying 'default settings'.
	* If a certain default value setting is causing the problem, try to zero in on which variable setting breaks the script.

If the problem persists, continue by writing a bug report:
1. Try to give stepwise instructions on how to reproduce the effect. For example:  
	* "1. Run the ... script.."
	* "2. Do this.."
	* "3. Do that.."
	* "  ...   ... "
	* "N. After this you should see [the effect].."
2. Optional: Send a (screen capture) image or a video of the problem.
	* Upload the video on YouTube (as an unlisted video) and share the link.
3. If a message window opens as a script fails, include the message to the report.
4. Include information about your setup: Reaper version and sample rate.

Further steps such as creating a project demonstration can be agreed upon after the initial report if needed.
