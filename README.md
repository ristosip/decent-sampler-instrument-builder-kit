Before sending in a bug report, please take the following steps:
1. Double-check for an user error. Please see the documention in the script files and the tutorial videos for help.
2. Make sure the unexpected behavior is replicable using an unmodified script file. 
	* This rule can be relaxed when it comes to modifying 'default settings'.
	* If a certain default value setting is causing the problem, try to zero in on which variable setting breaks the script.

If the problem persists, continue by writing a bug report:
3. Try to give stepwise instructions on how to reproduce the effect. For example:  
	1. "Run the ... script.."
	2. "Do this.."
	3. "Do that.."
	N. "After this you should see [the effect].."
4. Optional: Send a (screen capture) video of the problem.
	* Upload the video on youtube (as an unlisted video) and share the link.
5. Further steps such as creating a project demonstration can be agreed upon after the initial report if needed.
